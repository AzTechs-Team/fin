### finding your way home 🦈

fin. is an fun discord scavenger hunt wherein you (Sharkie) are lost at sea and need to find a way back home! You must swim through a whole bunch of sea-themed adventures to scour for clues. Beware tho, there is a whole bunch of fun decoys and spam messages to confuse you. If you do reach the other side, check out the leaderboard to see how well your friends did xD.
